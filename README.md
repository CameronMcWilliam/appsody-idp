# Iterative Dev Pack (IDP)

## Guideline

For a guide on how to write an IDP, please refer to the [IDP Draft](https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo-fork/blob/kdo-poc/docs/IDP-YAML.md) document.

## Testing

To test out the IDP, you may use the udo tool from the [repo](https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo-fork/tree/kdo-poc). Please note that this repo is a POC and not all the IDP features have been implemented.
